        Flowbite is first conceptualized and designed using the Figma software so everything you see
        in the library has a design equivalent in our Figma file.

        The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite are open source under the MIT
        license, whereas Tailwind UI is a paid product. Another difference is that Flowbite relies
        on smaller and standalone components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.

      <p class="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
        However, we actually recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite Pro, and even Tailwind UI as
        there is no technical reason stopping you from using the best of two worlds.
