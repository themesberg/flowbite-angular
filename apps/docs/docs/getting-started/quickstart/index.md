## Introduction

Flowbite Angular can easily be integrated into your project using NPM. It functions as a common
Angular library.

## Require via NPM

Make sure that TailwindCSS is installed.

```bash
npm install tailwindcss
```

Install Flowbite as a dependency using NPM by running this command:

```bash
npm install flowbite-angular
```

## TailwindCSS configuration

Make sure to use the flowbite-angular configuration preset in your styles.css

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';
```

Add this configuration to your application

```json
"styles": [
  "node_modules/flowbite-angular/flowbite-angular.css",
],
```
