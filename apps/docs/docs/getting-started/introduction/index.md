## Introduction

Flowbite Angular is an open-source library of UI components based on the utility-first Tailwind CSS
framework featuring dark mode support, a Figma design system, templates, and more.

It includes all of the commonly used components that a website requires, such as buttons, dropdowns,
navigator bars, modals, but also some more advanced interactives elements such as date pickers

All of the elements are build using the utility classes from Tailwind CSS and vanilla Angular.
