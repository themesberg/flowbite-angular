## What's angular primitives

Angular Primitives is a low-level headless UI component library with a focus on accessibility,
customization, and developer experience. Whether you're building a robust design system from scratch
or looking to enhance your existing one, our primitives are here to support you every step of the
way.

## Special thanks

We're using `NgPrimitivesDocumentation` to provide accessibility and behavior base so
flowbite-angular can be on design part. We want to address a special thanks to the maintainer of
ng-primitives which has provided a packages called
<span class="text-primary-500">@ng-primitives/state</span> providing a clean way to have state
management inside components.
